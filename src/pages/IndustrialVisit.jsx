              At CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
              Industrial Visits are an integral part of our academic curriculum.
              They offer students a unique opportunity to witness practical applications
              of theoretical concepts learned in classrooms.

              Through these visits, students interact with industry experts, observe
              real-time processes, and understand emerging technologies shaping the future.
              Such experiences not only enhance their technical knowledge but also
              build teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.

              Our students had the opportunity to visit Infosys Campus, Mysore – one of the largest corporate training 
              centers in the world. The visit provided deep insights into industry culture, modern training methodologies,
